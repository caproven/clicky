# clicky

Clicky is a simple project for trying out websockets. Kudos to [this article](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-websockets-go/) for giving explanations and a golang example.

Run clicky (`go run .` or `go build && ./clicky`) then head over to `http://localhost:8080`. There will be a button to click with a counter syncronized between all open clients. So feel free to open other tabs/windows or even access the server from a different machine.
